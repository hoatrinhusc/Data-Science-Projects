# Project Description

## Overview
This project involves a comparative analysis of performance differences between two models on a dataset of protein sequences. The analysis employs the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess statistical differences. Furthermore, the relationship between performance differences and sequence length is modeled using both Linear Regression and Quantile Regression approaches.

## Objectives
- **Performance Comparison**: Utilize the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the performance of two predictive models across various protein sequences.
- **Modeling Relationships**: Apply Linear Regression and Quantile Regression to examine how performance differences correlate with sequence length.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Statistical Analysis**: Wilcoxon signed-rank test
- **Regression Analysis**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Quantile Regression
